      <p>Memories from my childhood quietly resurface in unguarded moments. I sometimes wonder what kind of lives the friends with whom I once spent time are leading now. When I meet them again, what has society given to them?</p>
      <p>In my childhood, devices such as mobile phones that allow instant communication were neither widespread nor as astonishingly multifunctional as they are today. Around 1998 to 2003, the concept of "informatization" was promoted in China, and with it, personal computers began to spread into ordinary households. Back then, mobile phones were still feature phones, unable to access the internet. In my memory, I first owned a mobile phone only after I had already started using a computer—something that, by today’s standards, is hard to imagine.</p>
      <p>Nowadays in Chinese junior high and high schools, the system of compulsory self-study after school has become a serious issue. When I was in high school, I often had to stay at school studying until ten at night—it was exhausting. However, in my brother’s time, things were not so strict, and schools did not force students to stay for self-study. After school, instead of being chased by extra lessons as is common today, I would go with my brother to the local basketball court, and we would often play ball there. Many friends would gather to play, and when there were few people, we would go to someone’s house to play games or watch Japanese animation on TV together.</p>
      <p>Later, as my coastal hometown underwent rapid economic development, I also experienced several relocations due to my parents' jobs. My earliest memory of "home" begins with the placement of the bed. The bed was always set in the corner of the room, placed close to the wall, but intentionally leaving a narrow passage beside it. It felt as if that space was a small ritual of entering and leaving. Along the wall parallel to the bed was my desk. Between the desk and bed, a chair and bookshelf were naturally arranged, forming a quiet, independent study corner rather than being directly connected. Every time I moved to a new home, I always felt a lack of some emotional atmosphere, but that spatial structure had already unconsciously accumulated within me and later naturally influenced my creative work. In other words, at that time, "space" itself was my main medium of communication, and those spatial memories, after many years, would be awakened again upon encountering similar spaces. My work begins with reflections on such "space." Whether it is a space that exists in reality or one expressed on a flat surface, why do these spaces exist? Why do certain symbols or shapes suddenly remind us of specific times or places?—This has been the central question of my artistic inquiry for many years.</p>
      <p>After coming to Japan and visiting exhibitions, I felt that some twentieth-century Japanese art was influenced by the Mayan culture of Mexico and European symbolism, and gradually began to adopt "symbolic forms" as an expressive method. Similarly, my own work also starts from the most fundamental geometric shapes. I depict shapes that evoke a sense of familiarity for people, and I believe everyone should interpret them freely in their own way.</p>
      <p>The concept of "familiar forms" is cultivated through repeated learning and recognition as we grow. At first glance, it may seem like a skill based on logical reasoning, but in reality, it is established only by perceiving, utilizing, and accumulating spatial experience.</p>
      <p>Regarding this process of cognitive formation, the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget pointed out that as children progress from the "sensorimotor stage" to the "preoperational stage," they develop an understanding of simple forms and structures, and the ability to grasp the world structurally. In other words, when we feel a sense of familiarity toward a shape, it is evidence that such basic schemata have been formed in early childhood in conjunction with bodily sensations.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my work always revolves around the two axes of "spatial cognition" and "simplified forms." Through the use of minimal geometric language, I aim to express the primitive experiences that lie deep within memory and to quietly evoke resonance in the inner worlds of each viewer.</p>
